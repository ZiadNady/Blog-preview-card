# Blog Preview Card Project

## Overview

This project is a front-end component that displays a blog preview card. The card includes an image, publication date, title, a brief description, and author information. The design is clean, responsive, and incorporates custom CSS along with the Google Fonts API.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the blog preview card.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing all the styles for the blog preview card.
- **images/**: A folder containing images used in the project, such as `illustration-article.svg` and `image-avatar.webp`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language used to structure the content of the card.
- **CSS3**: The styling language used to design the appearance of the card.
- **Google Fonts**: The project uses the "Figtree" font from Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on various screen sizes.

## Structure

- **Container**: The `container` class wraps the content, giving it a white background, rounded corners, and a shadow for a card-like appearance.
- **Title and Text**: Styled with specific fonts and colors to ensure readability and a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Image**: The blog image is fully responsive and scales well on different devices.
- **Author Section**: Displays the author's image and name, styled for consistency with the rest of the card.

## How to Use

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the blog preview card.
3. Customize the `style.css` file to adjust the design according to your needs.

## Customization
